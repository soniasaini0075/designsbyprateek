                              <p>Particularly for brands that operate on a worldwide basis, constant innovation within the industry is crucial to differentiating a brand from the competition and enhancing the customer experience.</p>
                              <p>Many businesses, including Uber and Audi, have already shifted to their own distinctive design systems.</p>
                              <h4>What is design System?</h4>
                              <p>A design system is a set of guidelines for managing design at scale by minimizing duplication and establishing a common visual language and style across many pages and channels.</p>
                              <p>Here are a few additional definitions that, in my opinion, fit the bill.</p>
                              <p>“A design system may include a sketch library, style guide, pattern library, organization principles, best practices, templates, and more.”</p>
                              <p>“The resulting components and patterns may be used by your designers, developers, and editors in different preset combinations on your website, app, presentation, or other types of products—always remaining compliant to brand guidelines.”</p>
